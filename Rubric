Extensions to Linear Regression 
Learning Goal: Describe the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning,
               Discuss how bias and variance are related to over and underfitting
               Use Lasso and Ridge regression with sci-kit learn
               Compare and contrast Lasso, Ridge and non-regularized regression
               Use feature selection to obtain the optimal subset of features in a dataset

Question Number	Question	                                                                                    Point Value
1	 Use LinearRegression to predict the sales use cross_val_score to interpret the results.                        1.5
         Why cross_val score for testing is increasing/ decreasing. 	            
2	  Is it a overfitting or underfitting? what is bias -variance trade off?	                                0.5
3	 What method would you use to solve overfitting / underfitting problem? Use One Method?                            2
4        Use Regularization, Which is better Lasso / Ridge / Simple Linear Regression.                               1
